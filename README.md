These are Open Cv projects i made for hackberry!!!, It consits of a program that makes your face a pizza, a game where flappybird is on your finger and you collect coins to respawn them you do the spider man hand thingy, and a hand tracking module that can help you set up hand tracking faster in your projects, I followed a bit of some of the freeCodeCamp opencv tutorial. I hope you have fun
